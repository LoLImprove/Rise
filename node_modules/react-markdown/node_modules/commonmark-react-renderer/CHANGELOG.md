All notable changes will be documented in this file.

## [4.1.2] - 2016-03-12

### Changes

- Also join sibling nodes within paragraphs and similar (Espen Hovlandsdal)

## [4.1.1] - 2016-03-12

### Changes

- Join sibling text nodes into one text node (Espen Hovlandsdal)

## [4.0.1] - 2016-02-21

### Changes

- Use strings as renderers in simple cases (Glen Mailer)
- Set keys on lists and code blocks (Guillaume Plique)

## [4.0.0] - 2016-02-21

### Changes

- **Breaking change**: Inline HTML nodes are now wrapped in a `<span>`, block HTML nodes in `<div>`. This is necessary to properly support custom renderers.

## [3.0.2] - 2016-02-21

### Changes

- The default URI transformer no longer applies double URI-encoding.

## [3.0.1] - 2016-02-21

### Added

- The default URI transformer is now exposed on the `uriTransformer` property of the renderer, allowing it to be reused.
- Documentation for `transformLinkUri`-option.

## [3.0.0] - 2016-02-21

### Changes

- **Breaking change**: The renderer now requires Node 0.14 or higher. This is because the renderer uses stateless components internally.
- **Breaking change**: `allowNode` now receives different properties in the options argument. See `README.md` for more details.
- **Breaking change**: CommonMark has changed some type names. `Html` is now `HtmlInline`, `Header` is now `Heading` and `HorizontalRule` is now `ThematicBreak`. This affects the `allowedTypes` and `disallowedTypes` options.
- **Breaking change**: A bug in the `allowedTypes`/`disallowedTypes` and `allowNode` options made them only applicable to certain types. In this version, all types are filtered, as expected.
- **Breaking change**: Link URIs are now filtered through an XSS-filter by default, prefixing "dangerous" protocols such as `javascript:` with `x-` (eg: `javascript:alert('foo')` turns into `x-javascript:alert('foo')`). This can be overridden with the `transformLinkUri`-option. Pass `null` to disable the feature or a custom function to replace the built-in behaviour.

### Added

- New `renderers` option allows you to customize which React component should be used for rendering given types. See `README.md` for more details. (Espen Hovlandsdal / Guillaume Plique)
- New `unwrapDisallowed` option allows you to select if the contents of a disallowed node should be "unwrapped" (placed into the disallowed node position). For instance, setting this option to true and disallowing a link would still render the text of the link, instead of the whole link node and all it's children disappearing. (Espen Hovlandsdal)
- New `transformLinkUri` option allows you to transform URIs in links. By default, an XSS-filter is used, but you could also use this for use cases like transforming absolute to relative URLs, or similar. (Espen Hovlandsdal)

### Changed

### Added

- Add support for specifying which types should be allowed - `allowTypes`/`disallowedTypes` (Espen Hovlandsdal)
